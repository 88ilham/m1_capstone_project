**Important Note:**

**Dummy Dataset**

The current version of LinkUp relies on a dummy dataset. The data, including names and phone numbers, is hardcoded into the program for demonstration purposes only. Consequently, all contact information is pre-loaded and is not connected to any external database or API. While this setup is adequate for initial use cases, future iterations of the project may benefit from integrating a live dataset or external API. Such integration would provide a more dynamic and interactive experience by retrieving real-time data. As the project progresses, the possibility of implementing these features will be explored to enhance functionality and offer a more authentic and engaging experience.
